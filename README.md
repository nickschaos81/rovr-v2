Personal project to fulfill a childhood dream of building a remote robot for exploring from the comfort of my desk.
This will be done by using ChatGPT and following a step by step patteren to add each function to hopefully reduce issues with errors.
I will be updating this file as I go with the hopes that it will help me follow the path I used to create this robot.
